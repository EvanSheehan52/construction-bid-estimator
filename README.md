# This is an estimator for Small  Construction Companies. It allows them to enter in data regarding both the home they are building as well as the expected cost of each item in the home's construction. This can be done on a price-per-square-foot basis or on a lump sum per item basis. The estimator will then return the expected cost of construction as well as other relevent information. This is all done in an intuitive, easily-understandable, graphical manner.

# The program was buily with Qt Creator using C++; certain Stanford C++ libraries are utilized.
